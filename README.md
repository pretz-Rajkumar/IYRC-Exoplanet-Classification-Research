International Young Researchers' Conference Fall '23 Honorary STEM Research Paper: "Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Predicting Exoplanets with Kepler"

+ Developed and implemented eight different machine learning models for classifying exoplanets using data from NASA’s Kepler space mission.
  + Generic ML Models: Perceptron Algorithm, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier
  + Novel ML Models: Cat Boost Clasifier, Gradient Boost Classifier, XGB Classifier
  + DL Models: LSTM
+ Engineered a comprehensive data pipeline to preprocess raw data with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Normalization, Gaussian Filter, Standard Scaler, Synthetic Data Generation (SMOTE)
+ Resulted in 100% classification accuracy (macro F1 score of 1.0) with Decision Tree Classifier and XGB classifier, setting a new benchmark in exoplanet classification.
+ Independently published a research paper and presented findings (upon invitation) at IYRC’s annual conference, and was awarded the highest distinction in the STEM category (out of 325 submissions).
+ DOI to published paper: http://doi.org/10.34614/2023IYRC_F48
